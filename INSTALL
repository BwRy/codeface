Development Installation
========================

To get a development installation of codeface which reflects all changes you
make in the code, run:

  python setup.py develop --user

After making sure that $HOME/.local/bin is in the PATH, you should have a
codeface executable on the command line. Type

  codeface --help

for more information.

Database Setup
--------------

Codeface requires a MySQL dabase which is already pre-configured with the
SQL Schema specified in the 'bugzilla' repository in the file
DataModel/quantarchSchema.sql. The access credentials and name of the
database is configurable in codeface.conf

To run the integration tests, a copy of the database with the
default name 'quantarch_testing' is also suggested. The access for the
testing database is configurable in codeface_testing.conf.

Running the REST DB service
---------------------------

Before running codeface and the codeface integration tests, you need to make
sure that the codeface REST DB service is running and using the same
codeface.conf than codeface. Currently, the REST service is maintained
in the 'webui' repository. To run it, change to the subdirectory node.js and
run:
  node id_service.js <path/to/my/codeface.conf>

For integration tests, a REST service using the same codeface.conf than codeface
needs to be run. Note that by default, the codeface test command will use
codeface_testing.conf.

Setting up shiny-server
-----------------------

To generate a self-contained shiny-server-pack.tar.gz file, run
  bash shiny-server-pack.sh

If you are not on a PC directly connected to the internet, you can use a
pre-built version using wget, e.g. from
  wget http://www.ebke.org/shiny-server-pack4.tar.gz
In this case you have to untar the pack into the codeface project directory.

Now the shiny server can be started with
  ./shiny-server.sh
