      <h2>About Codeface</h2>
      <p>
	Codeface is a framework and interactive web frontend for the
	social and technical analysis of software development
	projects. It captures various data sources (revision control
	systems, bugtracking systems, mailing lists and complexity
	metrics) to provide:
	<ul>
	  <li>An <b>interactive web-frontend</b> to analyse projects on
	    various levels of detail from management summaries
	    (communication, collaboration, construction, complexity)
	    down to the raw data. It support direct <b>comparison</b> of
	    projects. </li>
	  <li>A <b>fully automated, parallelised analysis framework</b>
	    that scales to large projects (including the Linux
	    kernel). New projects can be added with minimal
	    configuration effort.</li>
	  <li>A <b>holistic database</b> that coherently integrates all
	    data sources and allows for complex, insightful
	    queries.</li>
	  <li>A <b>research platform</b> for software engineering using
	    advanced statistical techniques and methods of machine
	    learning on a significant amount of projects.</li>
	  <li>Quantitative analysis and objective classification
	    of <b>social aspects</b> of software engineering.</li>
	</ul>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Combine the powers
	    of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> for text
	    processing with the capabilities
	    of <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> for statistics
	    and machine learning, and the speed
	    of <a href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL</a> for handling big
	    data.</li>
	  <li>Detect central contributors based on their social
	    influence, not just on static measures like changed lines of
	    number of commits.</li>
	  <li>Multiple novel approaches to infer collaboration
	    structures from revision control systems.</li>
	  <li>Detection of most active discussion topics and communication
	    structure from mailing list using advanced text mining.</li>
	  <li>Distinguish between active and passive contributors to
	    mailing lists, and evaluate the structure of
	    discussions.</li>
	  <li>Various state-of-the-art clustering algorithms allow for
	    detecting closely interacting communities, and how they
	    change over time. Community quality estimation via Monte
	    Carlo methods.</li>
	  <li>Numerous traditional software engineering metrics resolved
	    by time to detect project evolution and trends.</li>
	  <li>Time series analysis (e.g., growth data, complexity
	    behaviour, communication volume): Estimate trends, determine
	    regularity and self-consistency.</li>
	  <li>Highly interactive web frontend based on reactive
	    programming
	    (<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/server/">Shiny</a>):
	    Technical details of interactive parameter passing are
	    handled by the framework, new visualisations and analyses
	    can be added with little effort.</li>
	  <li>Per-session configurable web frontend: Create analysis
	    panels that reflect the interest of individual users and
	    use-cases.</li>
	</ul>
