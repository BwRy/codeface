      <h3>Community evolution</h3>
      <p>It is well known that communication between contributors is a
	crucial factor for the success of a software development
	project. The figures on the right show how the communities
	of <a href="http://www.qemu.org">qemu</a> have evolved over time
	(dots represent contributors, and lines the collaboration
	strength.  The larger the dots, the more central the role of a
	contributor): During the early phases, the project was driven by
	few central developers. In recent times, the project has
	developed a professional development community, with roughly
	equally sized and shaped sub-communities without single central
	developers respectively points of failure.</p>

      <h3>Discussion culture</h3>
      <p>To determine the discussion culture on public mailing lists, we
	derive initiation-response diagrams that measure how many
	threads a given contributor initiated during a development
	cycle, and how many responses he/she received on average.
	
	Besides the raw numbers, the sizes of the dots indicate the
	centrality of a developer in the mailing list network, that is,
	how important he of she is for network structure.  Consider
	the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/â€Ž">Apache httpd</a>
	and <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> projects For
	Apache project, numerous contributors with little influence
	produce a substantial amount of traffic, while the OpenSSL
	community has a larger selection of medium to highly important
	contributors.  While a crypto library is typically only directly
	used by experts, a web server is of much more general interest,
	which attracts more non-specialist parties to contribute to
	discussions. Discussions in Apache are typically also more
	voluminous when it comes to the number of replies as compared to
	the openssl state, which is another indicator for a general
	interest versus expert community.</p>

      <h3>Connecting authors and topics</h3>
      <p>Not only the amount of communication, but also the topics
        discussed on the mailing list are of interest. We obtain these
        data by employing text mining methods that detect the most
        frequent keywords in discussions and which authors collaborate
        on these topics; the example shows data for the OpenSSL mailing
        list.</p>

      <h3>Time zone analysis</h3>
      <p>Git records author and committer time zone information, which
        allows for determining in which parts of the world development
        is done (or at least at which longitude). Both projects are
        truly international, albeit qemu tends to have a more pronounced
        focus on Europa than the Linux kernel, which also sees very
        active contributions from east and west America. </p>

      <h3>Engineering rigidity</h3>
      <p>Even simple technical metrics like the covariates associated
        with commits can deliver interesting information when examined
        properly: The figure on the right hand side shows
        release-resolved commit properties for the Linux kernel that
        additionally distinguish between development and stabilisation
        (release candidate) phases.  Thanks to the project's disciplined
        engineering approach, code integrated during stabilisation
        phases is consistently smaller, has more comments associated
        with it, and touches less files than during active
        development. This makes the Linux kernel a reliable and
        trustworthy project.

      <h3>Consistency</h3>
      <p>When a project is supposed to be used as a component of a

      <p>Independent of any absolute quality notions that can be
        subjective, it is possible to determine how self-consistent a
        project is with regard to its development behaviour. We can
        measure this by determining how similar adjacent
        release cycle time series are (0 for perfectly identical, 1 for
        totally different). In addition to the Linux kernel and jQuery,
        the comparison graph also includes
